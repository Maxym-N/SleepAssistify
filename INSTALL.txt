INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR SLEEPASSISTIFY

1. Prerequisites: Before compiling the program, ensure you have the required dependencies installed on your system. Specifically, you'll need the gcc compiler and pkg-config utility, along with the gtk+-3.0 library.

On a Debian-based system, you can install the dependencies using the following command:

sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libgtk-3-dev

2. Download the Program: Download the source code of SleepAssistify from the official repository or the provided location. Extract it if it is in a compressed format.

3. Compile the Program: To compile the source code, open a terminal in the directory containing the sleepassistify.c file. Run the following command:

gcc sleepassistify.c -o sleepassistify $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0)

This will generate an executable binary file named sleepassistify.

4. Run the Program: After compiling and installing the program, you can run it by specifying the correct path to the binary file. For example, if the binary is placed in a directory like /usr/local/bin, you can run the program by simply typing:

sleepassistify

However, if you place the binary elsewhere, make sure to specify the full or relative path to the executable. For instance:

/path/to/sleepassistify

If you want to run the program from anywhere without specifying the path each time, you can add its directory to the system's $PATH variable.

5. Uninstall the Program: To uninstall the program, you can simply remove the binary file from its installation directory. For example, if the program was installed to /usr/local/bin, you can run:

sudo rm /usr/local/bin/sleepassistify

If you installed it to another directory, adjust the path accordingly.

6. Troubleshooting: If you encounter issues during installation or execution, ensure that the required dependencies are installed and that the file paths are correctly specified. You can also check the system logs for any error messages that may provide further insight.
